### Description

AFPFS is a client implementation of the Apple Filing Protocol written in C which
can be used to access AFP shares exposed by multiple devices, notably Mac OS X
computers, linux devices exporting shares with netatalk, Apple Airport and 
Time Capsule products as well as other NAS devices from various vendors.


### Changelog

Read NEWS for more details.


### Installation and usage

See INSTALL, NEWS and docs/README.


### Credits and license

This is a fork of the original afpfs-ng project that has gone unmaintained
for quite some time. It is so far the only available open source AFP client.

This repository includes many patches collected by the XBMC project
(www.xbmc.org) as well as mine, in a bid to improve stability, performance and
to implement new features.
